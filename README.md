Daily Moon Forecast
===================

Daily Moon Forecast plugin adds a widget to WordPress that displays the current moon zodiac sign along with a forecast, which updates automatically as the moon sign changes. The widget also displays the current local date and time of the viewer, as given by the viewer's browser. 

The forecast is simply a one-sentence or two-sentence suggestion of the general mood in the air according to the zodiac sign the moon is in. Twelve forecasts are included, one for each of the twelve zodiac signs. By default, the widget will use the included forecasts. You have the option to write your own custom forecast for each moon sign in **Settings -> Daily Moon Forecast**.

Daily Moon Forecast uses the Swiss Ephemeris to get the longitude of the Moon.
